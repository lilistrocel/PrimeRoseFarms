# Development Log - PrimeRoseFarms

## 2024-12-19 - Initial Project Setup

### Tasks Completed
- Created CodingRules.md with initial development guidelines
- Created SystemArchitecture.md for tracking application structure
- Established documentation standards and file maintenance requirements

### Key Decisions
- No emojis in code or logs for professional appearance
- Windows 11 Pro environment with Command Prompt as default terminal
- Mandatory updates to DevLog.md and SystemArchitecture.md for all changes

### Files Created
- `CodingRules.md` - Development guidelines and standards
- `SystemArchitecture.md` - System structure and communication documentation

### Next Steps
- Define project requirements and technology stack
- Begin application architecture planning

## 2024-12-19 - Project Requirements Definition

### Project Overview
Creating a universal agricultural farm management application with role-based interfaces for different user types.

### User Roles Defined
- **Admin** - Full system access and user management
- **Manager** - Farm operations oversight and reporting
- **Agronomist** - Crop planning and agricultural expertise
- **Farmer** - Field management and worker supervision
- **Worker** - Field tasks (harvesting, planting, maintenance)
- **HR** - Personnel management and scheduling
- **Sales** - Customer relations and order management
- **Demo Account** - Limited access for demonstrations

### Architecture Decisions
- Multi-tenant web application approach
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Node.js/Express backend
- MongoDB database with encrypted data storage
- JWT-based authentication with role claims
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Multi-layer encryption system for data security

### Key Features Planned
- Role-based dashboard customization
- Contextual navigation per user type
- Permission-based data access
- Mobile-responsive design for field use
- Real-time synchronization for critical operations

### Next Steps
- Set up project structure and development environment
- Implement authentication system with role management
- Create base components and routing structure
- Develop role-specific dashboard templates

## 2024-12-19 - Technology Stack Update

### Database Change
- Switched from PostgreSQL to MongoDB for better scalability and flexibility
- MongoDB's document-based structure better suits agricultural data models

### Security Implementation
- Multi-layer encryption system designed for data protection
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- Four-level data protection classification system
- Field-level encryption before database storage

### Encryption Strategy
- **Level 1 (Public):** General farm data, non-sensitive information
- **Level 2 (Internal):** Operational data, schedules, basic user info  
- **Level 3 (Confidential):** Personal data, financial records, health information
- **Level 4 (Restricted):** Admin credentials, system configurations

### Next Steps
- Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript
- Set up MongoDB connection and models
- Implement encryption utilities and middleware
- Create authentication system with role-based access

## 2024-12-19 - Project Structure Setup Complete

### Tasks Completed
- Created Node.js project with TypeScript configuration
- Implemented comprehensive encryption system with AES-256-GCM
- Set up MongoDB connection with Mongoose
- Created User model with field-level encryption
- Implemented JWT-based authentication middleware
- Set up role-based authorization system
- Created Express server with security middleware

### Files Created
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `nodemon.json` - Development server configuration
- `env.example` - Environment variables template
- `src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and enums
- `src/utils/encryption.ts` - Multi-layer encryption service
- `src/config/database.ts` - MongoDB connection configuration
- `src/models/User.ts` - User model with encryption
- `src/middleware/auth.ts` - Authentication and authorization middleware
- `src/app.ts` - Express application setup
- `src/server.ts` - Server entry point

### Security Features Implemented
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- PBKDF2 key derivation with salt
- Four-level data protection classification
- JWT authentication with role-based access
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- HMAC signatures for data integrity
- Automatic encryption/decryption of sensitive fields

### Next Steps
- Create authentication routes (login, register, refresh)
- Implement farm and field management models
- Add worker management functionality
- Create role-specific API endpoints
- Set up frontend React application
