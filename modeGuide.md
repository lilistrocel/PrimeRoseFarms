🎯 Refined Modular Development Strategy
Development Principles:
Desktop First - Build management interfaces before mobile
Complete vs MVP - No dependencies = Complete, Has dependencies = MVP (track for completion)
Role-Specific Testing - Validate each module with intended user roles
Grouped Development - Subsequent modules enhance previous ones
Universal Test Mode - Mock data for dependencies vs real data integration
📊 Reorganized Module Groups
Group A: Foundation & Control (No Dependencies)
Build these COMPLETE - they're foundations for everything else
Module 1: Enhanced User Management Interface ⭐ START HERE
Dependencies: ✅ None (foundation)
Implementation: COMPLETE
Users: Admin, Manager
Features: User creation, role assignment, multi-farm permissions
Test Mode: Not needed (foundation data)
Module 2: Cost Management Interface
Dependencies: ✅ None (Manager input only)
Implementation: COMPLETE
Users: Manager, Admin
Features: Labor rates, infrastructure costs, material pricing
Test Mode: Not needed (Manager inputs costs directly)
Group B: Core Data Management (Logical Sequence)
Each builds on the previous - build in order
Module 3: Farm & Block Management Interface
Dependencies: ✅ User Management (Group A)
Implementation: COMPLETE (dependency exists)
Users: Admin, Manager
Features: Farm creation, block definitions, capacity planning
Test Mode: Uses real User data from Module 1
Module 4: Plant Data Management Interface
Dependencies: ✅ Farm/Block Management (Module 3)
Implementation: COMPLETE (dependency exists)
Users: Agronomist, Manager
Features: Plant specs, fertilizer schedules, growth requirements
Test Mode: Uses real Farm/Block data from Module 3
Group C: Operational Workflows (MVP then Complete)
Build MVP first, complete after Group D
Module 5: Task Management Interface 📝 MVP
Dependencies: ❌ Plant Data, Farm/Block (needs Group B complete)
Implementation: MVP with mock data
Users: Worker, Farmer, Manager
Features: Task assignment, progress tracking, mobile interface
Test Mode: Mock plant schedules and farm assignments
Module 6: Inventory Management Interface 📝 MVP
Dependencies: ❌ Plant Data, Cost Data (needs Group A+B)
Implementation: MVP with mock data
Users: Manager, Admin
Features: Stock tracking, material planning, reorder points
Test Mode: Mock plant requirements and cost calculations
Group D: Customer & Sales (Can be Complete)
Module 7: Customer & Sales Management Interface
Dependencies: ✅ Inventory (as MVP is sufficient)
Implementation: COMPLETE
Users: Sales, Manager
Features: Customer orders, stock allocation, pricing
Test Mode: Can use Inventory MVP data
Group E: Advanced Intelligence (Build Later)
Module 8: Sensor Monitoring Interface 📝 MVP
Dependencies: ❌ Plant Data, Task Management
Implementation: MVP with mock data
Module 9: Financial Analytics & Reporting
Dependencies: ❌ All operational modules
Implementation: MVP initially, complete after all modules
🔧 Universal Test Mode System Design
Test Mode Switch Implementation:
Test Mode Behavior:
Test Mode ON: Mock data for missing dependencies, realistic scenarios
Test Mode OFF: Real API calls, actual database integration
Hybrid Mode: Real data for completed modules, mock for dependencies
📋 Development Tracking System
Module Status Tracking:
✅ COMPLETE - Full functionality, real data
📝 MVP - Basic functionality, may use mock data
⏳ PENDING - Not started
🔄 UPGRADE - MVP ready for completion
Cross-Module Integration Tracker:
Track which MVPs need completion
Monitor dependency relationships
Plan integration points between modules
