# CRITICAL: Documentation-First Approach

## MANDATORY: Check Core Documentation FIRST
Before starting any task, the AI agent MUST:

1. **ALWAYS READ FIRST:**
   - `ProcessFlow.md` - Understand business processes and data flows
   - `DevLog.md` - Review current development status and recent changes
   - `SystemArchitecture.md` - Understand system structure and communication patterns
   - `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Review existing APIs and business process endpoints

2. **ALIGN WITH EXISTING SYSTEM:**
   - Follow established business process workflows
   - Maintain consistency with current architecture
   - Build upon existing implementations
   - Respect current development patterns and decisions

## MANDATORY: Update Documentation LAST
After completing any task, the AI agent MUST:

1. **UPDATE DevLog.md** - Record what was accomplished, decisions made, and next steps
2. **UPDATE SystemArchitecture.md** - Document any structural changes or new components
3. **UPDATE API_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Document new endpoints or modified business processes
4. **UPDATE ProcessFlow.md** - Update business process documentation if workflows changed

## CRITICAL REMINDER: Documentation-First Workflow

### Before ANY Task:
1. **READ** ProcessFlow.md, DevLog.md, SystemArchitecture.md, API_DOCUMENTATION.md
2. **UNDERSTAND** current system state and business processes
3. **ALIGN** with existing architecture and patterns

### After ANY Task:
1. **UPDATE** DevLog.md with accomplishments and decisions
2. **UPDATE** SystemArchitecture.md with structural changes
3. **UPDATE** API_DOCUMENTATION.md with new/modified endpoints
4. **UPDATE** ProcessFlow.md with workflow changes
