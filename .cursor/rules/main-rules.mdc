# PrimeRoseFarms AI Agent Rules

This document establishes comprehensive rules for the AI assistant to ensure consistency and alignment with the PrimeRoseFarms agricultural management system.

## Rule File Structure

The rules have been organized into focused, priority-based files for better maintainability:

### **CRITICAL PRIORITY (Always Applied)**
- **01-critical-documentation.mdc** - Documentation-first approach and mandatory documentation updates
- **02-code-quality-prevention.mdc** - TypeScript/React error prevention and code quality standards

### **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **03-environment-config.mdc** - Environment configuration and development setup
- **04-architecture-design.mdc** - System architecture and design principles

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **05-security-compliance.mdc** - Security, compliance, and testing requirements
- **06-integration-communication.mdc** - Integration patterns and communication protocols

### **LOW PRIORITY**
- **07-development-workflow.mdc** - Development workflow and process rules

## Quick Reference

### **Before ANY Task:**
1. **READ** ProcessFlow.md, DevLog.md, SystemArchitecture.md, API_DOCUMENTATION.md
2. **UNDERSTAND** current system state and business processes
3. **ALIGN** with existing architecture and patterns

### **After ANY Task:**
1. **UPDATE** DevLog.md with accomplishments and decisions
2. **UPDATE** SystemArchitecture.md with structural changes
3. **UPDATE** API_DOCUMENTATION.md with new/modified endpoints
4. **UPDATE** ProcessFlow.md with workflow changes

## Rule File Dependencies
