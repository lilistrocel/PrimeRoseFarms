# Development Workflow Rules

## Development Workflow
1. **Module-based development** - Develop features in logical modules (User Management, Farm Management, Plant Data, etc.)
2. **Milestone tracking** - Update DevLog.md after completing each module or milestone
3. **Demo user system** - Maintain demo users for all role types for testing and validation
4. **Script automation** - Use PowerShell scripts for development startup, shutdown, and testing

## Additional Rules
*This section will be expanded as more rules are added during development*
