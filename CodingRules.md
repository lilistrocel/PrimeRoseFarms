# Coding Rules and Guidelines

This document establishes common coding standards and guidelines to ensure consistency and alignment between the development team and AI assistant.

## General Rules

1. **No emojis in code or logs** - Keep all code and log messages clean and professional without emoji usage
2. **Windows environment** - The development environment is Windows 11 Pro
3. **Terminal preference** - Use Command Prompt as the default terminal in Windows
4. **Documentation maintenance** - Always keep documentation files updated

## Documentation Requirements

5. **DevLog.md** - Use this file to track and remember what is being coded, including progress, decisions, and changes
6. **SystemArchitecture.md** - Use this file to track how the app/apps are structured and how communication between components is implemented

## File Maintenance

- Always update SystemArchitecture.md when making structural changes
- Always update DevLog.md when making code changes or decisions
- Keep both files current and comprehensive
