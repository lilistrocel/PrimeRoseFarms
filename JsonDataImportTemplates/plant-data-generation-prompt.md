## Data Generation Guidelines

### 1. CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES
- **Growth Timeline Math**: `totalDays` MUST equal `germinationDays + seedlingDays + vegetativeDays + floweringDays + fruitingDays`
- **Farming Type**: Must be one of: `open_field_soil|open_field_desert|greenhouse|nethouse|hydroponic|aquaponic|aeroponic|special`
- **Category**: Must be one of: `vegetable|fruit|herb|flower|grain|legume|other`
- **Lifecycle**: Must be: `annual|perennial|biennial`
- **Light Requirements**: Must be: `full_sun|partial_shade|shade`
- **Water Level**: Must be: `low|moderate|high`
- **Demand Level**: Must be: `low|moderate|high|very_high`
- **Fertilizer Frequency**: Must be: `daily|weekly|bi_weekly|monthly`
- **Pesticide Frequency**: Must be: `preventive|curative|as_needed`
- **Growth Stage**: Must be: `seedling|vegetative|flowering|fruiting|harvest`
- **Application Method (Fertilizer)**: Must be: `soil_drench|foliar_spray|granular|injection`
- **Application Method (Pesticide)**: Must be: `foliar_spray|dust|injection|soil_drench`
- **Sustainability Score**: Must be between 1 and 10 (1-10 scale)
- **Environmental Impact**: Use realistic values for water footprint, carbon footprint

### 2. REALISTIC DATA REQUIREMENTS
- **Temperature Ranges**: Use realistic growing temperature ranges for the plant
- **pH Values**: Use appropriate soil pH ranges (typically 5.5-7.5 for most plants)
- **Growth Timeline**: Ensure realistic growth phases and total time to maturity
- **Yield Data**: Use realistic yield expectations based on plant type and farming method
- **Resource Requirements**: Include appropriate fertilizer and pesticide needs
- **Market Pricing**: Use realistic market prices in appropriate currency units

### 3. FARMING TYPE CONSIDERATIONS
- **Open Field Soil**: Traditional soil-based farming, consider weather factors
- **Open Field Desert**: Desert-adapted plants, drought tolerance, heat resistance
- **Greenhouse**: Controlled environment, year-round growing, climate control
- **Nethouse**: Protected cultivation, pest management, weather protection
- **Hydroponic**: Soilless growing, nutrient solutions, water-based systems
- **Aquaponic**: Fish-plant integration, nutrient cycling, water quality
- **Aeroponic**: Air-based root systems, misting, high oxygen
- **Special**: Unique growing methods, experimental techniques

### 4. SEASONAL PLANTING GUIDELINES
- **Cool Season Crops**: Plant in fall/winter/early spring
- **Warm Season Crops**: Plant in late spring/summer
- **Year-Round Crops**: Can be planted in multiple seasons
- **Greenhouse Crops**: Can extend growing seasons

### 5. QUALITY STANDARDS
- **Size Standards**: Realistic size ranges for the plant type
- **Color Standards**: Natural color variations for the plant
- **Texture Standards**: Appropriate texture descriptions
- **Defects**: Common defects that affect quality

### 6. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
- **Water Footprint**: Liters of water per kg of produce
- **Carbon Footprint**: CO2 equivalent per kg of produce
- **Sustainability Score**: 1-10 scale (10 being most sustainable)
